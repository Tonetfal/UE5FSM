 * Finite machine's state defining behavior of an object. <br> <br>
 *
 * # Functions to add and change state behavior: REGISTER_LABEL(), GOTO_STATE(), GOTO_LABEL(), and StopLatentExecution.
 * - REGISTER_LABEL(): macro to register a label. Read the macro documentation for more detailed information.
 * - GOTO_STATE(): macro to go to another state. Change current state the finite state machine is in.
 * - GOTO_LABEL(): macro to go to another label. Start executing a given label.
 * - StopLatentExecution: cancel all latent functions (coroutines) running under owning state machine.
 *
 * # Labels
 * - Labels are special functions coroutines are meant to be used in, making them a good place to create latent gameplay
 *   code.
 * - To distinguish them from normal functions use "Label_" as a prefix.
 * - They are like mini-states within a single state, but, when a label finishes executing its code, nothing happens
 * automatically afterwards. Labels either have to manage themselves, so that they carry on the logic invocation, or
 * something else, like state functions, has to do it instead; it depends on the context.
 *
 * # State data
 * - State data is an object that a particular state has, and it's accessible from outside using the owning state
 * machine to make it easy to expose information other states might need to base their behavior on, or pass some
 * information to this state.
 * - The object is created once on state registration, and destroyes at the end of the state lifecycle.
 * - To define the subclass of the data object you want to use for a particular state use UMachineState::StateDataClass.
